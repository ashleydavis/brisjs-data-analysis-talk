# brisjs-data-analysis-talk

This is the code for my talk to [the BrisJS meetup](https://brisjs.org/) on 6th August 2018.

It's a talk on data analysis with JavaScript and a demonstration of [my open source libraries Data-Forge and Data-Forge Plot](http://www.data-forge-js.com/).

To learn more about working with data in JavaScript please read my book [Data Wrangling with JavaScript](http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2).

Do your prototyping and exploratory data analysis in JavaScript with [Data-Forge Notebook](http://www.data-forge-notebook.com/).
